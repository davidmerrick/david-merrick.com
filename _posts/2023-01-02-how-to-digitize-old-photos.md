title: How to digitize old family photos with the Epson FastFoto
---

My mom, bless her heart, had for years been scanning all of our family photos via a flatbed scanner, one-by-one. 
Needless to say, this was an extremely slow, tedious process, and also became a management headache because 
the app she was using for it didn't correctly timestamp the photos, so they would show up all over the place in Google and Apple Photos.

For her birthday this year, I made up my mind to solve this and help her finally complete the project as quickly and painlessly
as possible.

Initially, I had the idea to just send the photos off to a bulk-scanning company. There are several around that will 
scan photos in high-resolution for a low price per photo. This was a non-starter, though, because I knew that 
neither of us were comfortable taking the risk that our precious memories would get lost in the mail, and it wasn't clear to me 
whether these companies would even handle timestamping the photos for us.

So the requirements for the solution were:
* Scanning the photos must happen at home
* Photos must be able to be scanned in bulk
* There must be an easy way to timestamp the photos

After doing some research, the [Epson FastFoto scanner](https://www.amazon.com/Epson-FastFoto-FF-680W-Wireless-High-Speed/dp/B07DLX26BB/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2JZWCOFTDF6QU&keywords=epson+fastfoto&qid=1672699932&sprefix=epson+fastfot%2Caps%2C198&sr=8-3&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.ac2169a1-b668-44b9-8bd0-5ec63b24bcb5)
fit the bill perfectly.
It seemed to be the most popular of the consumer bulk scanners out there, could scan as quickly as one photo per second, 
had a price point that made it actually cheaper than sending the photos off to be scanned, 
and came with software that would timestamp the photo batches. As a bonus, my mom could use it after we completed the project
in her genealogy/family history work. Sold.

We managed to scan all of my parents' old photo albums and the ones from my pre-digital childhood in just a few weeks.
Most of the time it took was just taking photos out of albums and putting them back; the actual scanning was incredibly
quick and painless.
